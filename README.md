# 🏗️ The Blueprint: AI Software Architect

> **Turn rough ideas into actionable engineering plans in seconds.**

## 🚀 Overview

**The Blueprint** is a full-stack Next.js application designed to bridge the gap between an "app idea" and "technical execution."

Instead of spending days planning database schemas and architectures, users simply input a concept. The system uses **Generative AI (Llama 3)** to instantly compile a professional technical specification document.

**🎨 Design Inspiration:**
The project's name and visual identity—specifically the deep electric blue intro sequence and architectural lines—pay homage to **Jay-Z's legendary album _The Blueprint_**. It merges the precision of software architecture with the iconic aesthetics of the album that defined a generation.

## ✨ Key Features

* **⚡ Instant Architecture:** Generates feature lists, tech stacks, and risk assessments instantly.
* **📊 Live System Diagrams:** Automatically renders **Mermaid.js** flowcharts to visualize system architecture and data flow.
* **📂 File Structure Generation:** Outputs a complete project file tree (folder structure) ready for scaffolding.
* **💎 Iconic UI:** A custom "Intro Sequence" featuring the "blue compass" aesthetic inspired by Jay-Z's album art.
* **📋 Export Ready:** One-click **"Export to Markdown"** feature to easily copy the plan into GitHub READMEs, Notion, or Jira.
* **🛠️ Robust Error Handling:** Smart parsing logic to clean and repair AI-generated JSON and Mermaid syntax errors.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project was built using the latest modern web technologies:

* **Framework:** [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router, Server Actions)
* **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (Strict type safety)
* **AI Model:** [Meta Llama 3](https://llama.meta.com/) (via Hugging Face Inference API)
* **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* **Animations:** [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) (Complex transitions & intro)
* **Visualization:** [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/) (Diagram rendering)
* **Icons:** [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)

## 🔧 How It Works

1.  **Input:** The user selects a template (SaaS, E-commerce, Crypto) or types a custom idea.
2.  **Processing:** The app sends a highly engineered prompt to the **Llama 3** model, enforcing a strict JSON schema output.
3.  **Visualization:**
    * The JSON response is parsed.
    * The `folderStructure` is rendered as a code block.
    * The `mermaidDiagram` string is cleaned and rendered into an SVG flowchart.
4.  **Output:** The user gets a complete blueprint that can be exported.
